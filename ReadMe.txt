Tool For Making Screenshots
---------------------------
Two ways:
1. Choose the Window of which you want to make a screenshoot.
	Press the button "Move mouse ...",
	move the mouse (a cross) to the window,
	release the mouse button on the background. On a grey background (128,128,128) the cross vanishes. That's fine.
	Press then the confirm button ("Window chosen").
	A rectangle is drawn around the page. Confirm.	
2. The dialog has probably vanished. ALT - TAB it.
Or do:
1. Press 'Choose snipping region manually'
	choose the area of the screenshot (it's like in snipping tool).
	The window is automatically choosen - you pointed to it.

3. Enter the number of pages you want
	This sets the number of Page-Down events which will be sent to the window.
4. Press 'DoIt'.
	Wait.
5. The screenshoots can be assembled to a pdf-file.

Keep hands of everything while copying.
