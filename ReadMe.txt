Tool For Making Screenshots
---------------------------

1. Choose the Window of which you want to make a screenshoot.
	Press the button "Move mouse ...",
	move the mouse (a cross) to the window,
	release the mouse button on the background. On a grey background (128,128,128) the cross vanishes. That's fine.
	Press then the confirm button ("Window chosen").
	A rectangle is drawn around the page. Confirm.
	This may lead to some misbehaviour of the target application.
2. The dialog has probably vanished. ALT - TAB it.
OR better do:
1. Press 'Auto choose ...' (which doesn't anything automatic so far)
	choose the area of the screenshot (it's like in snipping tool).
	The window is automatically choosen.
3. Enter the number of pages you want
	This sets the number of Page-Down events which will be sent to the window.
4. Press 'DoIt'.
	Wait.
5. The screenshoots can be assembled to a pdf-file.
